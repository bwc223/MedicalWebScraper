# MedicalWebScraper
A web scraper that retrieves and saves the results from a given medical category from an HTML page to a .txt file.

The .txt file within the project is the result of running the App.java file given the website parameters. (i.e. if you change the website domain for a different health topic, the results will reflect it within the .txt file.)
